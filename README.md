# Heart Health Chatbot ðŸ’“

## Project Description
A GenAI-powered medical chatbot designed specifically for heart health.  
It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to combine large language models with custom heart health PDF documents, providing accurate and context-aware answers through an easy-to-use Streamlit interface.

## Why This Technology?
- **RAG Pipeline:** Enables fact-based answers by augmenting LLMs with external medical documents.  
- **PubMedBERT Embeddings:** Domain-specific embeddings optimized for biomedical texts, improving search relevance.  
- **ChromaDB:** Fast and efficient vector store for semantic search.  
- **LlamaCpp & BioMistral:** Open-source LLM offering strong performance on local machines.  
- **Streamlit:** Quick and interactive deployment of the chatbot web app.  
- **Python-dotenv:** Secure management of API tokens and environment variables.

## Challenges Faced
- Balancing model size and performance for local deployment.  
- Ensuring fast retrieval from large medical documents.  
- Keeping API tokens secure and out of public repos.  
- Crafting prompt templates for truthful and relevant responses.

## Features
- Conversational interface for heart health queries.  
- Uses custom PDFs as medical knowledge base.  
- Open-source LLM-based with semantic search.  
- Streamlit-powered web app deployment.  
- Secure environment variable handling.
